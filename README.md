🪨⛏️ Rock vs Mine Prediction
Welcome to my Rock vs Mine Prediction project! 🎉

📌 About the Project
This project uses a simple Machine Learning (ML) model to predict whether an object detected by sonar is a Rock 🪨 or a Mine 💣. It’s a classic classification problem using the popular Sonar Dataset.

🚀 How it Works
📊 Data: The dataset contains sonar signals bounced off objects under the sea.

⚙️ Algorithm: A classification algorithm (like Logistic Regression or Random Forest) is trained on the dataset.

🎯 Goal: Given the sonar signal data, the model predicts whether it’s a Rock or a Mine.
